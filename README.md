with Online Package Manager integrated into Lazarus)

For details please take a look at the website:

Website is a bit outdated, 
but should some provide basic information about this program.

Added Squirrel binary for linux

Previous version of Squirrel was known to work with following Linux versions:

-Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon,
-Kubuntu 20.04 (KDE),
-Xubuntu 20.04 (XFCE),
-CentOS 9 Stream,
-openSUSE Tumbleweed 20211202

This binary is known to work with Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon 5.0.7
but I can see no reason why it wouldn't work 
with all the versions listed above.
(It is compiled with newer version of Lazarus)
If there is a problem with it please let me know.
