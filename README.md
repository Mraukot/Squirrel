# Squirrel
Simple visual steganography software for Windows and Linux

Binary for Windows provided.
I will provide binary for linux.
Mac users: Please download Lazarus and compile Squirrel yourselves.
(it requires Lazarus and DCPCrypt library that needs to be downloaded 
with Online Package Manager integrated into Lazarus)

For details please take a look at the website:
https://squirrel.eu5.org/

Website is a bit outdated, 
but should some provide basic information about this program.
What more can I say?
Enjoy :-)
